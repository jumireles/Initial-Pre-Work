//Learned that by using the (+=) operator I can append a string to another string
//variable and save coding space.
// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "cool";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr+=someAdjective;
