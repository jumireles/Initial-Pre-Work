//Learned how for loops work which is similar to while loops but inside the
//for loop 3 conditions are declared the initilization; condition; final expression
//and the for loop will excute the code inside of it until the condition is no longer true.
// Example
var ourArray = [];

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}

// Setup
var myArray = [];
for(i = 1; i < 6; i++){
    myArray.push(i);
}
// Only change code below this line.
