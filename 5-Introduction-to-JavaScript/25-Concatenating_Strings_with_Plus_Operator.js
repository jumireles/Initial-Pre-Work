//Learned how to use the (+) operator to build a single string is is composed of two
//different strings. Also need to remember that (+) operator does not add spaces.
// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
