//Learned how to use the != operator which is a inequality operator which tests to see
//if a value is not equal to what ever it is being compared to. If unequal it returns true
//if equal it returns false.
// Setup
function testNotEqual(val) {
  if (val != 99) { // Change this line
    return "Not Equal";
  }
  return "Equal";
}

// Change this value to test
testNotEqual(10);
