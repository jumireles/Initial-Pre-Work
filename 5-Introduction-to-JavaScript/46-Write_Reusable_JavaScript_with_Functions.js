//Learned how to create a reusable function and how to print something to the
//console by using the console.log command, I also learned how to recall a function
//by calling the functions name. Also to create a function you have to start with
//the word function with a unqiue name.
// Example
function ourReusableFunction() {
  console.log("Heyya, World");
}

ourReusableFunction();

// Only change code below this line
function reusableFunction(){
    console.log("Hi World");
}
reusableFunction();
