//Learned how to create objects which is like creating a varaible but
//in this case curly brackets are used to put in strings or numbers for properties,
//which are then seperated by commas, can use arrays inside objects.
// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "dogs",
  "legs": 5,
  "tails": 2,
  "friends": ["Many"]



};
