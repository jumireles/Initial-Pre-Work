//Learned to find the nth to last character in a string by using bracket notation
//and getting the length of the string and subtracting the value being searched for.
// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var thirdToLastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 3];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
